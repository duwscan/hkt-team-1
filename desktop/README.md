## Puppeteer Integration

### Architecture Overview
The app uses a **hybrid architecture** where:
- **React Frontend**: Handles UI and API communication
- **Electron Main Process**: Manages Puppeteer operations
- **IPC Communication**: Frontend and main process communicate via Electron IPC

### Browser vs Desktop Mode
- **Browser Mode**: Mock Puppeteer interface for development
- **Desktop Mode**: Full Puppeteer automation via Electron main process

### Chrome Recorder Script Support
The app fully supports Chrome Recorder exported scripts:
- **Script Format**: Detects and executes both `run()` function and default export formats
- **Step Tracking**: Monitors each step execution with detailed logging
- **Screenshot Capture**: Automatic screenshots at key points
- **Performance Monitoring**: Collects browser performance metrics
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error capture and reporting

### Browser Automation Features
- **Cross-platform Chrome**: Uses bundled Chromium for consistency
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live console logging and error detection
- **Performance Metrics**: Page load times, memory usage, and more
- **Screenshot Management**: Organized screenshot storage and display
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of browser resources

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn package manager
- Chrome/Chromium browser (optional, uses bundled version)

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Development mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts both React dev server and Electron app.

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run electron-pack
   ```

### Configuration

- **API Endpoint**: Update `API_BASE_URL` in `src/services/apiService.js`
- **Electron Settings**: Modify `public/electron.js` for window preferences
- **Build Settings**: Configure `electron-builder` in `package.json`
- **Puppeteer Options**: Adjust browser settings in `src/services/puppeteerRunner.js`

## Usage

### 1. Authentication
- Launch the app
- Enter your API key to authenticate
- The key is stored locally for subsequent sessions

### 2. Project Management
- Select a project from the dropdown
- Filter by screen, tags, or search terms
- View script details including target URLs and descriptions
- Select individual scripts or use "Select All"

### 3. Test Execution
- Click "Run Selected" to start execution
- Watch real browser automation in action
- Monitor progress in real-time with step-by-step tracking
- View logs, screenshots, and results as tests complete
- Stop execution at any time if needed

### 4. Results & Analysis
- Review execution summary with success/failure counts
- Browse captured screenshots
- Analyze performance metrics
- View detailed logs for debugging
- Results are automatically submitted to backend API

## Chrome Recorder Scripts

### Supported Script Types
1. **Chrome Recorder Exports**: Scripts exported from Chrome DevTools Recorder
2. **Custom Puppeteer Scripts**: Scripts written specifically for Puppeteer
3. **Hybrid Scripts**: Scripts that combine both approaches

### Script Requirements
- Must export a `run()` function or have a default export
- Should use Puppeteer page object for browser interactions
- Can include Chrome Recorder specific step definitions
- Should handle errors gracefully

### Example Script Structure
```javascript
export async function run(extension, page) {
  // Chrome Recorder extension for step tracking
  if (extension && typeof extension.beforeAllSteps === 'function') {
    await extension.beforeAllSteps();
  }

  // Your test steps here
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await page.click('#login-button');
  // ... more steps
}
```

## Mock Data

For development and demo purposes, the app includes mock data:

- **Projects**: E-commerce Website, Mobile App API, Admin Dashboard
- **Scripts**: Login flows, product searches, cart operations, checkout processes
- **Test Execution**: Real Puppeteer automation with sample scripts

## API Integration

The desktop application integrates with a Laravel backend API for real-time data management. The API provides comprehensive endpoints for managing projects, screens, test scripts, and test results.

### Backend Requirements

- **Laravel 10+** with SQLite/MySQL database
- **API Key Authentication** for secure access
- **File Storage** for test scripts and screenshots
- **Database Indexes** for optimal performance

### API Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `desktop/` directory:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

### Key Features

- **Real-time Data Sync**: Projects, screens, and test scripts are fetched from the backend
- **Screen-based Script Filtering**: Test scripts are primarily filtered by screen_id for better organization
- **Advanced Search**: Full-text search across script names, descriptions, and content
- **Tag-based Organization**: Scripts can be categorized and filtered by tags
- **Performance Optimization**: Database indexes and efficient querying for large datasets

### Filtering Priority

The application uses a hierarchical filtering system:

1. **Screen ID (Primary)**: Scripts are primarily filtered by screen for logical organization
2. **Project ID (Secondary)**: Additional filtering by project for broader scope
3. **Search Terms**: Text-based search across script content
4. **Tags**: Frontend filtering for script categorization

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/projects` | GET | List all projects |
| `/projects/{id}/screens` | GET | Get screens for a project |
| `/test-scripts/search` | GET | Search scripts with filtering |
| `/test-scripts/{id}/content` | GET | Get script JavaScript content |
| `/test-results/save` | POST | Save test execution results |
| `/test-results/{id}/screenshot` | POST | Upload test screenshots |

### Data Flow

1. **Project Selection**: User selects a project from the dashboard
2. **Screen Loading**: Screens for the selected project are loaded
3. **Script Filtering**: Scripts are filtered by selected screen (primary) and project (secondary)
4. **Execution**: Selected scripts are executed with real-time progress tracking
5. **Results Submission**: Test results and screenshots are submitted to the backend
